    <h1>One pot gardener</h1>
    <h3></h3>
    <p>John Muir said "The clearest way into the Universe is through a forest wilderness."
      But what if you don't have a forest close by?
      Well, then it might be a garden. But in the case the garden is out of reach,
      how about a potted plant? A potted plant that will take care of you
      more than you have to take care of it. The secret: it comes with its own gardener.</p>

    <h3>Fred</h3>
    <p>Fred has been taken cared by our gardener since one month now.
      He needed more light and, after that, his teenager growth period started.</p>

    <h3>Maya and Leia</h3>
    <p>These lovely ladies were a bit too hot for their own sake.
      Since our gardener noticed the temperature, they are now enjoying a cooler environment,
      further away from the radiator. </p>

    <h3>Mosty</h3>
    <p>Mosty survived just fine on his own,
      but with his own private gardener, and the awareness of his water needs (a much larger
      supply), he now thrives.</p>

  <h1>What it is</h1>
  <p>
    A potted plant with it's own, private gardener.
    The One pot gardener, as the name says is an semi-automated gardener for one pot.
    It automatically waters your plant per its specific needs. On top of that,
    it will also tell you if your plant
    has enough light, is in an appropriately dry setting and
    it's surrounding temperature is not too cold or too hot.

  <h1>How it does it</h1>
  <p>
    With some sensors that monitor your plant's environment, a microcontroller,
    a water pump and (this is where you come in)
    a water supply that you need to provide for the gardener, it will take good care of
    your plant no matter if you are on vacation or not.
