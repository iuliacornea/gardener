    <h1>One pot gardener</h1>
    <h3></h3>
    <p>John Muir said "The clearest way into the Universe is through a forest wilderness."
      But what if you don't have a forest close by?
      Well, then it might be a garden. But in the case the garden is out of reach,
      how about a potted plant? A potted plant that will take care of you
      more than you have to take care of it. The secret: it comes with its own gardener.</p>

    <h3>Fred</h3>
    <p>Fred has been taken cared by our gardener since one month now.
      He needed more light and, after that, his teenager growth period started.</p>

    <h3>Maya and Leia</h3>
    <p>These lovely ladies were a bit too hot for their own sake.
      Since our gardener noticed the temperature, they are now enjoying a cooler environment,
      further away from the radiator. </p>

    <h3>Mosty</h3>
    <p>Mosty survived just fine on his own,
      but with his own private gardener, and the awareness of his water needs (a much larger
      supply), he now thrives.</p>
